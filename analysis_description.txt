ANALYSIS DESCRIPTION

====================
The Dataset
====================

The dataset (RStudio Data.csv) contains survey data from 101 students at the University of York regarding their opinions on campus wildlife. It includes:

- Demographic variables: Degree Level (Undergraduate/Postgraduate) and Faculty (Science, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities)

- Animal rating variables: Individual ratings (1-5 scale) for 10 different animals commonly seen on campus: Ducks, Geese, Squirrels, Swans, Foxes, Rabbits, Seagulls, Long Boi (a famous duck), Hedgehogs, and Mice

- Summary variables: Total number of animals spotted and average opinion score


====================
Data Pre-processing Performed
====================

The data pre-processing steps included:

- Variable selection: Created a subset (dataNew) containing only key variables: Degree Level, Faculty, Number of animals, and Average Opinion

- Variable renaming: Simplified column names for easier reference

- Data type conversion: Ensured numeric variables were correctly formatted using as.integer() and as.numeric()

- Data recoding: Expanded Faculty abbreviations to full names (e.g., "SocSci" → "Social Sciences", "Arts&Hu" → "Arts and Humanities")

- Feature engineering: Created new variables including:
  * OpinionGroup: Binary classification (High/Low) based on Opinion ≥ 3 threshold
  * NumberPerDay: Daily animal sighting rate calculated as Number/7

- Data filtering: Generated focused subsets (e.g., Science faculty only, high opinion respondents)


====================
Analysis Performed
====================

The analysis consisted of:

- Descriptive statistics: Calculated means, medians, standard deviations, and other summary statistics for all variables using summary(), describe(), and describeBy()

- Group comparisons: Examined differences in animal sightings across faculty groups using tapply() and describeBy()

- Data visualization: Created bar plots with error bars showing mean number of animal sightings by faculty, including:
  * Statistical significance indicators comparing all faculty pairs
  * Accessible color schemes (viridis palette)
  * Interactive versions using plotly

- Statistical testing: Visual comparison of means across faculty groups with significance testing via geom_signif()
